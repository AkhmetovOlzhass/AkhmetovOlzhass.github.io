This Agreement is between you and CryptoShield only, and not with Google. CryptoShield is solely responsible for the Software. <br /> <br />The Google Chrome Web Store is owned and operated by Google. Your use of the Google Chrome Web Store is governed by a legal agreement between you and Google consisting of the Google Chrome Web Store Terms of Service (found at https://ssl.gstatic.com/chrome/webstore/intl/en/gallery_tos.html), and the Google Chrome Terms of Service (found at https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/eula_text.html). In addition, your use of the Google Chrome Web Store is subject to the Google Chrome Web Store Program Policies (found at https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies). <br /> <br />Google has no obligation to provide any maintenance or support for the Software. <br /> <br />To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Google shall have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Software, and shall not be liable for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty. CryptoShield shall not be required to provide a refund to you under any circumstances. <br /> <br />Google shall not be responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Software or your possession and/or use of the Software, including but not limited to (i) product liability claims, (ii) any claim that the Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, or (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. <br /> <br />Google shall not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement or discharge of any claim that the Software or your possession and/or use of the Software infringes a third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights. <br /> <br />You represent and warrant that (i) the Software shall not be downloaded or used in, or transported to, a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &ldquo;terrorist-supporting&rdquo; country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. <br /> <br />In order to continually innovate and improve Google Chrome and Google Chrome Web Store, Google may collect certain usage statistics from Google Chrome, Google Chrome Web Store and Supported Devices, including but not limited to, information on how Google Chrome, Google Chrome Web Store and Supported Devices are being used. The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve Google Chrome and Google Chrome Web Store for users and developers and is maintained in accordance with Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy. To ensure the improvement of the Software, limited aggregate data may be available to CryptoShield upon its written request. <br /> <br />From time to time, Google Chrome may check with remote servers (hosted by Google or by third parties) for available updates to extensions (including the Software), including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. You agree that such updates will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you. <br /> <br />From time to time, Google may discover an extension that violates Google developer terms or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Google Chrome will periodically download a list of such extensions from Google&rsquo;s servers. You agree that Google may remotely disable or remove any such extension from user systems in its sole discretion. <br /> <br />Google may, in its sole discretion at any time and without notice, restrict, interrupt or prevent use of the Software, or delete the Software from your Google devices, or require CryptoShield to do any of the foregoing, without entitling you to any refund, credit or other compensation from CryptoShield or any third party (including, but not limited to, Google or your network connectivity provider). <br /> <br />Google and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and have the right (and shall be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you. <br /> <br />CryptoShield Inc.&rsquo;s address is 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE 19801 US.5. <br />Fees and Subscription Terms <br /> <br />While we make available a free version of the Software, we may charge for certain tools or features and functionality of a premium version of the Software. You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide CryptoShield with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (&ldquo;Payment Provider&rdquo;), as a condition to signing up for a premium version of the Software for which we charge. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing CryptoShield with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that CryptoShield is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to CryptoShield hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify CryptoShield of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder. CryptoShield reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting through the Services. <br /> <br />As a user of the Services, you will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any premium version of the Software (the &ldquo;Service Subscription Fee&rdquo;) at the time you purchase such premium version (each, a &ldquo;Service Commencement Date&rdquo;). Except as set forth in the Agreement, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. <br /> <br />Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Agreement. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a &ldquo;Renewal Commencement Date&rdquo;) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at CryptoShield&rsquo;s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date (or in the event that you receive a notice from CryptoShield that your subscription will be automatically renewed, you will have thirty days from the date of the CryptoShield notice), by logging into and going to the &ldquo;Change/Cancel Membership&rdquo; page of your &ldquo;Account Settings&rdquo; page. If you do not wish your Account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please contact CryptoShield at team@cryptoshield.app or log in and go to the &ldquo;Change/Cancel Subscription&rdquo; page on your &ldquo;Account Settings&rdquo; page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize CryptoShield to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if CryptoShield does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that CryptoShield may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). <br /> <br />If payment for the Services under this Agreement is subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to CryptoShield, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify CryptoShield for any liability or expense CryptoShield may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon CryptoShield&rsquo;s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, &ldquo;Sales Tax&rdquo; means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax. <br /> <br />You agree to make all payments of fees to CryptoShield free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to CryptoShield will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide CryptoShield with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid. <br /> <br />CryptoShield may use Stripe, Inc. (&ldquo;Stripe&rdquo;) as its third party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe&rsquo;s Privacy Policy: https://stripe.com/privacy, and hereby consent and authorize CryptoShield and Stripe to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more third party service provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions. By making reservations on the Services, you also agree to be bound by Stripe&rsquo;s Seller Terms: https://stripe.com/ssa. <br />Third-Party Components and Services <br /> <br />The Software may include certain third-party components.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. <br />Dispute Resolution <br />Please read the following arbitration agreement in this section(&ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;) carefully. It requires that you and CryptoShield arbitrate disputes against one another. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS SECTION 14 CONTAINS PROVISIONSGOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND CryptoShield HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILLBE RESOLVED. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS SECTION 14 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENTTO ARBITRATE WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEENYOU AND CryptoShield BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION 14 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTIONAND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 14 CAREFULLY. <br />Applicability of Arbitration Agreement <br /> <br />Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and CryptoShield agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and CryptoShield may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or CryptoShield may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. <br />Informal Dispute Resolution <br /> <br />There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and CryptoShield. If that occurs, CryptoShield is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and CryptoShield agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and CryptoShield therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (&ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&rdquo;). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informa l Dispute Resolution Conference (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to CryptoShield that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to team@CryptoShield.app or regular mail to our offices located at 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE19801 US. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, email address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. <br /> <br />The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party&rsquo;s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section. <br />Waiver of Jury Trial <br /> <br />YOU AND CryptoShield HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and CryptoShield are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement&rdquo; above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. <br />Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief <br /> <br />YOU AND CryptoShield AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration&rdquo;, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration.&rdquo; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, &ldquo;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,&rdquo; are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and CryptoShield agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or CryptoShield from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. <br />Rules and Forum <br /> <br />The Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and CryptoShield agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the &ldquo;Request&rdquo;). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars;(4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. <br /> <br />If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel&rsquo;s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel&rsquo;s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2)the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contention shave evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. <br /> <br />Unless you and CryptoShield otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration&rdquo; is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules. <br /> <br />You and CryptoShield agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties&rsquo; attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. <br />Arbitrator <br /> <br />The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration&rdquo; is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch. <br />Authority of Arbitrator <br /> <br />The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,&rdquo; including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration,&rdquo; all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration.&rdquo; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. <br />Attorneys&rsquo; Fees and Costs <br /> <br />The parties shall bear their own attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or CryptoShield need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. <br />Batch Arbitration <br /> <br />To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and CryptoShield agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against CryptoShield by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (&ldquo;Batch Arbitration&rdquo;).All parties agree that Requests are of a &ldquo;substantially similar nature&rdquo; if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (&ldquo;Administrative Arbitrator&rdquo;). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator&rsquo;s fees shall be paid by CryptoShield. <br /> <br />You and CryptoShield agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. <br /> <br />This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. <br />30-Day Right to Opt Out <br /> <br />You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE 19801 US, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. <br />Invalidity, Expiration <br /> <br />Except as provided in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo;, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with CryptoShield as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction. <br />Modification <br /> <br />Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if CryptoShield makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to CryptoShield at 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE 19801 US, your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products distributed through the Services or this Agreement, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to Agreement) remain in full force and effect. CryptoShield will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.15. <br />Exclusive Venue <br />&zwj;To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and CryptoShield agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. <br />Waiver and Severability <br /> <br />CryptoShield&rsquo;s waiver of any breach under this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of any earlier or later breach. No failure or delay by CryptoShield in exercising any right under this Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law and/or not enforceable, that provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect. <br />Assignment&zwj; <br /> <br />You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise. CryptoShield may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of its rights or obligations under this agreement without restriction. <br />Export&zwj; <br /> <br />The Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from CryptoShield, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations. <br />Electronic Communications <br /> <br />The communications between you and CryptoShield use electronic means, whether you use the Services or send us emails, or whether CryptoShield posts notices through the Services or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from CryptoShield in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that CryptoShield provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights. <br />Notices&zwj; <br /> <br />Where CryptoShield requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing CryptoShield with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to CryptoShield is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by this Agreement, CryptoShield&rsquo;s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to CryptoShield at the following address: 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE 19801 US. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by CryptoShield by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address. <br />Force Majeure <br /> <br />CryptoShield shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. <br />Questions, Complaints, Claims <br /> <br />If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Software, please contact us at team@CryptoShield.app. We will do our best to address your concerns.
